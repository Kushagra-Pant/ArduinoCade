This is a project a friend and I created for our Computer Engineering Final Performance Task. It is an Arduino arcade-style console with games, built with LED Dot Matrices. 

The 2024 Edition was the first ever edition we created. It has 2 games.

The 2025 Edition was the second edition. It adds another game, is compact, and comes with many consolidated features.

More information on either edition, as well as a circuit diagram, can be found in their respective reports.
